# RoofMap (flood-roofing-estimator)

RoofMap is a production SaaS for NZ roofing companies (roofmap.co.nz), run by
Flood Roofing Ltd in Whangarei. Real customers use it daily — treat every ship
accordingly.

## Layout

- `floodroofing/frontend/app.html` — the app: one very large HTML file
  (CSS + markup + JS, ~62k lines). Edit it with careful, count-asserted
  replacements; when scripting edits with Python, always read/write with
  `encoding='utf-8', errors='surrogateescape'` (the file contains emoji).
  Syntax-check after scripted edits by feeding each inline `<script>` to
  `new Function()` — a stray quote in a 62k-line file is otherwise found by
  a customer.
- `floodroofing/frontend/sheet-plan.js` — the sheet engine (plain global
  script loaded last, not a module): `renderRoofSheetPlan` → per-roof
  `_renderRoofSheetPlanInner`, the ridge-claim takeoff
  (`_ridgeClaimSections`), the `_sheetsAcross` rounding rule and the
  section/group data the Job Pack reads (`window._lastSheetSections`,
  `window._lastSheetCounts.groups`).
- `floodroofing/frontend/sw.js` — service worker, network-first with a 5 s
  timeout, so a reload picks up a new build. "Still seeing the old numbers"
  means the app was not reloaded, not that the ship failed.
- `floodroofing/backend/server.js` — the entire Express backend, including the
  idempotent boot migration DDL list (search `create table if not exists`).
  New columns are added there as `alter table ... add column if not exists`.
- `floodroofing/tests/*.mjs` — self-contained suites. `run.mjs` runs them all
  (~19 min, ~186 suites four at a time, plus the sheet-layout gate on a full
  run; `JOBS=1` for one at a time), or one by name:
  `node floodroofing/tests/run.mjs inboxui`. A NEW suite must be added to
  the list in `run.mjs` or it never runs. Pipe the runner through `tail` and
  you get tail's exit code, not the runner's — use `set -o pipefail`.
  Run the full gate in the background and never `pkill -f tests/run.mjs`
  from the same shell (it kills its own command).
- `floodroofing/docs/ci_sheet_tests.js` — the sheet-layout gate (37 shapes;
  Big-L expects 66 strips). Runs alone in ~40 s and has its own GitHub
  workflow, so run it first after any engine change.
- `floodroofing/tests/fakepgrst.mjs` — in-process fake PostgREST. No DDL
  defaults (set every column explicitly on insert), no `in` filter (returns
  all rows), DELETE returns deleted rows. Failure seams on the db object:
  `__fail500 = 'table'` (+ `__failMsg` for the error text), `__failInsert`,
  `__missing = ['column']`.
- Test fixtures worth knowing: `fixtures-report41.json` is the five-roof job
  behind reports 51 and 52; `fixtures-report50.json`, `fixtures-doublel.json`
  and `fixtures-tee.json` are the hip-and-valley shapes the owner counted by
  hand. `tools/sheet-shots.mjs` renders any fixture to PNGs of the layout,
  the calc check and the cut list — send those to the owner BEFORE the gate
  when the counts are in question.
- `floodroofing/tools/` — generators, never their output (`.gitignore` keeps
  it that way). `demo-shots.mjs` → `demo-slideshow.mjs` → `demo-record.mjs`
  build the sales demo; `restore-check.mjs` verifies a backup restore;
  `build-og-card.mjs` renders the link-preview card.

## Pipeline — how changes reach users

main → GitHub Tests CI → promote workflow → `production` branch → Railway
(backend) + Vercel (frontend). Never push `production` directly.

Discipline (non-negotiable):
1. Develop and commit on the session's designated `claude/...` branch only.
2. Before fast-forwarding main: run the FULL local suite in the background
   (`node floodroofing/tests/run.mjs`) on a clean committed tree and require
   exit 0. If files changed mid-run, the result is void — re-run clean.
3. Ship with `git push origin HEAD:main` (fast-forward only). Batch several
   commits into one ship when possible.
4. After a green gate the pipeline lands in ~6 minutes; don't poll unless
   something looks wrong.
5. **A ship is not done until the promote workflow is green.** It verifies
   both halves, and both are the proof:
   - the FRONTEND, by fetching roofmap.co.nz/app and comparing it byte-for-byte
     with app.html at the promoted commit;
   - the BACKEND, by reading `build` from the Railway service's `/health` and
     comparing it with the promoted SHA. A failed backend deploy used to be
     completely silent — promote went green, the site served the new
     app.html, and the API behind it ran the old code, which is the worst
     shape a half-ship can take because the frontend calls endpoints and
     columns that are not there yet. That step is forgiving where it cannot
     TELL (no answer, or a build of `unknown`): those warn and pass, because
     a check that cries wolf gets ignored and is then worth nothing on the
     day it is right. Only a backend definitely serving a different commit
     fails it.

   The frontend step waits 20 MINUTES and the backend 10, raised from 8 and 7
   on 2026-09-18 after three promotes in a row went red on Vercel builds that
   were still running and then landed fine — one of them left a real change
   unshipped because the red was assumed to be the usual false alarm. Vercel
   builds here have taken up to 18 minutes. Waiting longer costs a slow
   workflow on a slow day; giving up early costs the whole point of the check.

   Neither `production` containing the commit nor a 201 from the Vercel deploy
   hook is proof. Both were true on three ships that never went live.
   If that step goes red, the FIRST thing to check is the Vercel project's
   **Settings → Build and Deployment → Ignored Build Step**. It must be
   `Custom` with the command `exit 1` (exit 1 = build, exit 0 = skip). On
   `Automatic`, Vercel skips any commit whose SHA it has already deployed —
   and the SHA always reaches Vercel first as a preview of the `claude/...`
   branch, so EVERY promote was a repeat and was skipped. That single setting
   cost most of a night and three ships reported as live that never were.
   Failing that, tell the owner to open Vercel → Deployments → newest →
   **Promote to Production**. Never report a change as live on the strength
   of the branch or the hook alone.

## Conventions

- The public pages (`landing`, `pricing`, `fergus`, `early-access`, `signup`)
  must agree with the `PLANS` table in server.js about what each tier gets.
  `tests/sitecopy.mjs` pins it; change the table and the pages together.
- Sitemap dates come from git: after committing any public-page change, run
  `node floodroofing/tools/sitemap-dates.mjs` and commit the sitemap before
  the gate. `tests/seo.mjs` fails on a stale date (skipped on shallow clones).
- Every company-scoped table needs `company_id` AND `user_id` from day one —
  `_scopeCompany()` filters on both.
- Test seams: `__TEST_MAIL_FETCHER`, `__TEST_MAIL_JSON`, `__TEST_SMTP_FAIL`,
  `__TEST_AI` (routed by system-prompt sniffing). Suites import server.js
  in-process, so seams are set as globals before import.
- New behaviour ships with test pins in the matching suite; UI suites drive
  the real app.html in Playwright with route stubs.
- Secrets: never print ADMIN_TOKEN or DB connection strings; creds are
  AES-encrypted at rest via MAIL_CRED_KEY/JWT_SECRET derivation.
- No model identifiers in commit messages or code comments beyond the
  standard commit trailer.
- Error monitoring emails the owner on uncaught exceptions and 5xx — silence
  false alarms at the source rather than muting the reporter.
- An UNPROMPTED platform email (the trial drip, the trial-ended email) is
  HELD, never sent from a company address. `_allowedFromAddress` drops a
  From outside the verified sending domain back to `EMAIL_FROM`, which on
  this deployment is office@floodroofing.co.nz — so RoofMap's onboarding
  mail was reaching strangers out of the owner's roofing inbox. Both sweeps
  bail on `_platformMailboxSendable(MAIL_SUPPORT)` BEFORE they stamp their
  watermark, so no trial loses its place, and sending resumes by itself once
  roofmap.co.nz is verified in Resend or `EMAIL_FROM` points at it. Mail
  somebody asked for (an invoice, a cancellation, a requested link) is never
  held — a person who pressed a button and got nothing is worse off than one
  who got the right thing from an odd address. `tests/platformfrom.mjs`.
- A settings PUT echoes the row back. MERGE that echo into `S.settings`,
  never replace with it: a backend that predates a field echoes the row
  without it and silently undoes what was just saved.
- The app and the API are different origins. A response header a `fetch()`
  needs to read (`Content-Disposition`, say) must be named in
  `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` or the browser withholds it.
- A function that both alerts AND swallows its error makes every caller's
  `catch` dead code. If any caller can recover, throw — see `openJob`'s
  `quiet` option.
- A failed database read is an ERROR, never an empty result. `_mustRead()`
  turns a PostgREST failure into a 503 `UPSTREAM_UNAVAILABLE`; reading it as
  "no rows" once logged the owner out of his company, dropped the Fergus
  key and showed "No subscription found" after a reload.
- Sheet counting rule (the owner's, pinned in `tests/report52.mjs`): each
  roof counts its OWN gutter ÷ sheet cover, rounded up from a tenth of a
  sheet (10 m / 0.762 = 13.12 → 14; 13.05 → 13). Overlapping roofs never
  change each other's count. Every count site goes through `_sheetsAcross`.
- The sheet LAYOUT diagram (the tiled cut-plan picture) is HIDDEN from
  users since 2026-09-14 — the owner judged it not right yet. One flag,
  `SHEET_LAYOUT_HIDDEN` in app.html, takes it out of the Maps panel kinds,
  the page types, placed pictures and the legacy print sections; a saved
  page of that type shows a note. The engine still runs underneath, so the
  counts, the cut list, the Sheet calc check and the sheet-layout gate are
  unchanged. Flip the flag to false to bring it back everywhere, and put
  `sheetplan` back into `tests/jpmaps.mjs` and `tests/jpallroofs.mjs` when
  you do. Do not offer the layout diagram to users again without the owner
  looking at screenshots of it first (`tools/sheet-shots.mjs`).
- The Job Pack cut list belongs to the office once touched. The first
  edit (quantity, length, hide, add row) freezes it in
  `DRAW.matSheetFrozen`; it is rebuilt only when the roof's groups change,
  carrying the edits onto the nearest new rows, and "Reset from map" throws
  the freeze away. Never re-derive a row the office has typed on.
  A MULTI-ROOF job pack lists sheets one roof at a time ("Main Roof
  sheets", "Roof 2 sheets"; report 54) and each roof keeps its own freeze,
  overrides, hidden rows and extras under `DRAW.matSheetByRoof[idx]`;
  `_jpSheetScope(idx, fn)` swaps a roof's set into the job-level slots the
  row builder and setters read, so every onclick on a roof's section goes
  through `_jpSheetScoped(idx, 'fnName', …)`. `_jpSheetRowsAll()` is what
  the order email and the supplier order read. All of these stores (and
  `S.jobPack`) are saved with the job since 2026-09-18 — before that a
  reload dropped every typed quantity.
- Which roofs a job pack covers is saved on the job (`S.jobPack.roofSel`)
  and, until the office picks by hand, FOLLOWS THE QUOTE: the main roof,
  roofs folded into its price, and an optional roof once the customer adds
  it (`_jpQuotedRoofIndices`). The map pictures, the clearlite, the sheets
  and every quantity follow that pick; a pricing pass that needs one roof's
  group uses `_matSelOverride()`, never the saved pick. Tests that read the
  whole job's list call `_jpSelectAllRoofs()` first.
- The customer's quote on a PHONE is a book, not the A4 pages reflowed:
  `_qbRender()` into `#qpRoot` behind `html.qp-book`, one page on screen with
  arrows to turn it, driven by `_qbPages()` (cover, condition, Re-Roof
  Proposal, then a page per choice, then the total). It is phone width AND
  customer mode AND not printing — `_qpBookActive()` — so the office, the
  tablet, every print and the PDF still get the A4 document, untouched. The
  book reads the SAME helpers as the paper (`_qpBaseSub`, `_qpCardDeltas`,
  `_custBarRows`, `_qpInteractiveRoofBlock`), so the two cannot disagree about
  a figure; never give the book pricing of its own. A page that does not apply
  is simply not in the list (no gutter → no brackets page; Zincalume → no
  colour page) and the numbering closes up. The price appears on the Re-Roof
  Proposal page and not before it. `_fitCustomerView` settles the `qp-book`
  class BEFORE its printing guard, or a Save-as-PDF prints the A4 document
  with the phone's layout rules still applied. `tests/quotebook.mjs`.
  The office can LOOK at that book without sending anything: the Quote tab's
  Computer / Phone switch (`_setQuotePreviewMode`, `QP_PREVIEW.phone`) frames
  the same book as a phone inside the preview card under
  `html.qp-phone-preview`. That class is deliberately NOT `qp-book` — the
  customer's layer takes the page's scrolling away and the app around the
  frame has to keep working. Both print paths drop the frame and re-render
  before capturing, because a print is always the A4 document. The book's
  cover photo resolves through the SAME chain as the paper's (slot
  assignment → the company's `branding.hero_photo` → the built-in fleet
  shot), never a job photo. `tests/quotepreview.mjs`.
  The two roof profiles are DRAWN from the Roofing Industries profile sheets
  in real millimetres (`_qbCorrugateGeometry` 76.2mm pitch / 19mm high / 762
  cover; `_qbRibGeometry` TrimRib S, 190mm rib pitch / 25mm high / 63mm rib
  base / 32mm top / 127mm pan with a 45×5mm stiffener / 760 cover), at ONE
  scale across both so a customer comparing them sees that a 5-Rib really is
  the deeper sheet. Change the numbers only against those sheets.
  The LAST page draws the roofs the quote covers read-only
  (`_qpInteractiveRoofBlock({readOnly:true})`, which drops the include/exclude
  buttons and the "tap to add" labels in the map itself) — the choosing was
  done on page three and re-offering it under the Accept button invites a
  change nobody meant. Accept on a phone does NOT open the confirmation
  popup: the name and the terms tick are on the page (`#qbAcceptName`,
  `#qbAcceptTerms`) and `acceptQuoteDigitally` validates them and goes
  straight to `_acceptQuoteFinalize`. A computer still gets the popup, because
  the A4 document has no inline name field and the record needs one. Neither
  path can record an acceptance without a name and a tick. On the book the
  roofer's quoted choice on each option page carries a "Recommended for your
  roof" pill (the `isDefault` item); the arrows read Back / Next; and after
  acceptance the LAST PAGE LEADS with `_qbAcceptedBlock` ("Quote accepted",
  who and when, what happens next, Save a copy as PDF) — no popup on the book,
  because the page is the confirmation. The office gets the acceptance email;
  the customer does not, so the block must never promise them one.
- A DRAFT IS NEVER AN ACCEPTED QUOTE. "Create new draft" and "Open saved
  draft" go through `_qvFreshDraft()`, which strips `accepted`/`declined` and
  un-flags an accepted share. The copy used to carry `accepted` with it, and
  the share TOKEN does not change — so the next send handed the customer a
  brand-new quote their browser locked on sight (every option frozen, Next
  dead), while the office saw nothing wrong because the office view does not
  lock. The frozen "Accepted quote" version keeps the acceptance; the draft
  starts clean. `unacceptQuote()` must also REACH the saved job: it leaves any
  frozen version first and saves with `{force:true}`, because plain
  `saveCurrentJob()` returns early and silently on a locked job and an accepted
  job is locked — the office unlocked, reloaded, and the acceptance was still
  there. Both pinned in `tests/quoteversions.mjs`, including a check that a
  customer's browser would NOT lock the new draft.
- The Quote tab bar is three things, not a row of same-weight buttons: the
  actions (`.qa-btn`; one `.qa-btn-primary`, `.qa-btn-warn` for Undo
  acceptance, the rest behind a native `<details class="qa-more">`), ONE
  version selector (`.qv-seg`, the version on screen filled in: Draft / Sent /
  Accepted) with the draft actions and saved list behind `<details
  class="qv-menu">`, and ONE sentence (`.qv-status`) about the customer's link.
  A flat row of "Sent quote · Accepted quote · New draft · Save draft · Saved
  drafts" beside a "link shows this draft, live" badge read as a contradiction
  and the owner called it more confusing than before; the sentence has to say
  BOTH halves when a new draft follows an acceptance ("the link now shows this
  draft, which they have not accepted; the earlier acceptance is kept"). Colour
  means STATUS, not decoration. Menus are `<details>` so they work on a phone
  with no JS; `innerText` of the bar excludes a closed menu's items, so tests
  pin the summary text (`Drafts (1)`), not the items.
- Prices by steel grade: the base grade's sheets, flashings and back-trays
  ARE the price book's top-level fields; any other grade's own set lives
  under `price_book.by_grade[id]` and is used only when it has a price in
  it (`_pbGradeHasPrices`) — then `_pbForGrade(_pbGradeInUse())` feeds the
  material rows, `_gradeFactor` is 1 for it, and the customer's grade delta
  is the real difference on the graded rows (`_gradeDeltasSnapshot`, frozen
  onto the quote as `gradeDeltas`). A grade with no prices of its own still
  runs on the percentage from the Products list. `tests/gradeprices.mjs`.

## Four things that have been broken twice

**The roof engine.** `buildHipValleyLines` runs a real straight skeleton, then
`_skelSnapRectilinear` tidies it: welds junctions the solver left a few pixels
apart, closes an apex where two hips meet and nothing carries on, collapses a
line doubling back on itself, and lets a narrow link's roof die into the face
of a wider wing instead of climbing to its ridge. Do NOT add a shortcut that
returns before the solver — one was added to fix H shapes and it broke every
L, T and U in production. `buildRectilinearRoofLines` survives on the GABLE
path only, where the sheet-layout gate depends on it. `tests/roofreal.mjs`
pins four outlines taken from real feedback reports, structurally: nothing
outside the building, nothing stopping in mid-air, no open apex, no kink,
every ridge level or plumb.

**The drawing scale.** `DRAW.scaleMetresPerPx` is metres per IMAGE pixel. The
canvas size and `DRAW.zoom` have nothing to do with it. Dividing by how large
the photo happens to be drawn makes every measurement move when the roofer
zooms — the same roof read 1.86m at 490% and 2.95m at 310%, on live quotes.
The aerial's own Mapbox zoom does change it, and must.

**Believing one API call.** Twice now a working Fergus link has reported
itself dead because a single request failed: the connection test asks for the
jobs list sorted and paged, and not every partner account answers that query
string. It falls back through plainer requests now — but NOT on 401/403,
where a rejected key must fail on the first call rather than be hammered.
`tests/fergstale.mjs` pins both that and the stale job-mapping recovery.

**The cut list.** Three feedback reports in a row (50, 51, 52) were the
same fault in different clothes: rows re-derived from the roof on every
render, with the office's edits re-attached by each row's original length.
Any re-render that shuffled the rows (a tab switch before the map had
drawn, the bump-out splitter peeling or not, a label matched to a different
row) put a typed quantity on a different row and lost rows. The freeze above
is the fix; the splitter and value-matcher in `_jpBuildSheetRowsAuto` still
run for an untouched list, and the feedback report now carries the whole
cut-list state (`cutList` in `_roofGeometryPayload`) — read that before
guessing.

## Diagnosing a subscriber's integration

Settings → "Something not working?" runs the probes support would run by
hand. It emails the report to support AND offers it as a PDF
(`POST /jms/diagnostic.pdf`, written by a small Courier-only PDF writer in
server.js — no library, deliberately). The report carries the API key's
LENGTH and never the key; keep it that way, `tests/jmsdiag.mjs` pins it. Ask
the owner for that PDF before guessing at a Fergus fault.

## Open at last handover — 2026-09-18

Delete or rewrite this section as it is dealt with; a stale list here is
worse than none.

**Recently shipped 2026-09-18, watch for fallout:** the job pack's roof
pick now follows the quote by default (a job whose extra roofs are still
optional packs the main roof only until the customer adds them — the pills
say so and "Follow the quote instead" is the way back); Settings has a
Guides tab (with the Loom run-through), "Quote's Product Options" carries
the price book with per-grade prices, and "Suppliers" is just suppliers and
flashing types. The practice roof stand-in is the owner's own aerial
(`brand/practice-aerial.jpg`, 1 px = 63.92 mm); the server's practice job
picture still wins when it exists.

**Waiting on the owner (Aron):**
- Price the Measure plan. It exists in `PLANS` (one seat, measuring only;
  the server refuses a customer quote link and `/email/send-order` on it)
  but is sold nowhere: the billing screen and the trial-ended window show
  it only when `STRIPE_PRICE_MEASURE` is set (`/subscription.offered`), and
  the pricing-page card is written at $79 with `hidden` on it. To sell it:
  create the Stripe prices, set the env vars, remove `hidden`, add its
  Offer to the pricing JSON-LD, update the "$149, $299 or $549" intro and
  `tests/sitecopy.mjs`.
- Rotate the Fergus API token and the Railway `ADMIN_TOKEN` — both were
  readable in screenshots shared during a session.
- Four aerial screenshots for the demo slideshow (Mapbox is unreachable from
  the build environment, so those slides are placeholders): aerial found,
  mid-trace, outline finished, roof lines generated.
- Ring Sharon about the steel grade on quote 3206 before that roof is
  ordered — the acceptance email and the PDF disagreed about which grade was
  standard.
- SMS/uptime alarm on `/health`; run the restore drill once
  (`tools/restore-check.mjs`); add the crews then paste the schedule import;
  paste the real price book so it can become the shipped default.
- Send the customer email about the report 50–52 fixes (drafted 2026-09-14)
  with the "please reload the app" line kept in.

**Trial emails, shipped 2026-09-17 — watch the first fortnight:** the drip
(`_trialDripSweep`: days 1/3/7/12, `subscriptions.trial_drip`, hourly,
`TRIAL_DRIP_ENABLED=false` to stop it), the gone-quiet alert to support@
(`_quietTrialSweep`: 3 silent days, once per trial, `quiet_alert_at`,
daily) and the trial-ended email all share one shape: DB watermark in
`platform_state`, mark first then send, admin `POST /admin/*/run` to force
a pass. `tests/trialdrip.mjs` pins the timing. The analytics page carries
"Why trials cancelled" from `cancel_feedback`. A preview of every email is
generated by the scratch script described in the 2026-09-17 session (drive
the admin endpoints against `fakepgrst` and capture the relay).

**Onboarding, shipped 2026-09-16 — watch the first real accounts through it:**
a new account (server says `ui_flags.first_roof = 'offer'`: no jobs, never
answered) lands on Map Roof with the practice job open — John Smith,
23 Don Buck Road, Massey (`FIRST_ROOF` in app.html, opened like the sample
with `S.demoKind = 'test'`) — and the tour engine runs `_firstRoofSteps()`
as kind `firstroof`: steps complete on `until()`, Next does `onNext` or
skips, `wait: true` parks the card until its popup exists. The `ONB`
arbiter allows one layer at a time; the branding wizard is summoned by
`_brandingBeforeSend(then)` at the first real send, never at sign-in; the
setup guide and 29-step tour are opt-in. `tests/onboarding.mjs` drives the
whole walkthrough with imagery blocked (the labelled fallback picture).
The practice address flies to hard-coded coordinates (`FIRST_ROOF.lat/lon`,
approximate — check the aerial actually shows 23 Don Buck Road and adjust).
Measurement: `app_time` carries `screen`, `screen_left` is sent on hide/
close, `walkthrough`/`onboarding_path`/`roof_source`/`help_requested`/
`output_created` are allow-listed in `_usageProps` (server.js); the daily
report shows where the minutes went, where each person left and how far
the practice job got. Privacy policy v1.1 discloses it — the policy's own
30-day-notice clause means the owner owes subscribers an email about it.

**Being reworked:** the sheet layout diagram is hidden (see Conventions).
Bringing it back means a layout that matches the owner's counting rule
sheet-for-sheet: longest sheets first, that area squared off, then each wing
worked out separately — the calc check already draws that; the tiler does not.

**Recently shipped, watch for fallout:** the ridge-claim takeoff for
hip-and-valley roofs with two or more ridges (`_ridgeClaimSections`, pinned
by `tests/sheetclaim.mjs` on the owner's hand counts: T = 71, staircase =
69, double L = 73); the cut-list freeze; `/quote-activity` serving its last
good feed after a statement timeout (`tests/quotefeedcache.mjs`). If a
5xx email names `/quote-activity` again it is an office that never had a
good read in that server's lifetime — look at the query, not the cache.

**Product thinking, agreed but not built:** the trial's first twenty minutes
should walk a new roofer to their OWN first quote — address, trace, quote, in
that order — before the schedule or the inbox is mentioned, and should get
their real supplier rates in before that first quote. Lead with measuring and
quoting everywhere a stranger meets the product; the rest is why people stay,
not why they try it.

## Working style

The owner (Aron, office@floodroofing.co.nz) sends batches of fixes/features,
often as phone screenshots. Keep replies tight; ship whole batches through
one gate; report what shipped and what to try, in plain language.
